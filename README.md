This is a very simple TicTacToe game at the current stage the source code is found in `src/main/TicTacToe.java` this program runs on a console and being new to java I have no idea how most things works that's why it is not in compiled form so you need JDK install to use it. 
Therefore if you can give me some tips it would be helpful :).

This is a two player game and currently in development. I have plans for making a computer player and a GUI too. But it may take some time as for when I am writing this.
Any feature request or issue or suggestion or anything related will be really helpful for me at this moment. :smile:

Thanks for reading and have a great day!
